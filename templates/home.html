                <h4>Diabetes</h4>
                <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.</p>
                <h5>Symptoms</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Urinating often.</li>
                    <li>Feeling very thirsty.</li>
                    <li>Extreme fatigue.</li>

                <h4>Chronic kidney disease</h4>
                <p>Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.</p>
                <h5>Symptoms</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nausea</li>
                    <li>Vomiting</li>
                    <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                    <li>Muscle twitches and cramps</li>
                    <li>Sleep Problems</li>
                    <li>Weight loss</li>

                <h4>Liver disease</h4>
                <p>Symptoms of liver disease can vary, but they often include swelling of the abdomen and legs, bruising easily, changes in the color of your stool and urine, and jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes. Sometimes there are no symptoms. Tests such as imaging tests and liver function tests can check for liver damage and help to diagnose liver diseases.</p>
